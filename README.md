## **Features**
- **Machine Learning Classifier**: Trains a neural network to identify malicious URLs.
- **Database Mapping**: Checks URLs against databases like AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal for instant validation.
- **Network Analysis**:
  - WHOIS lookups
  - Reverse IP searches
  - Geolocation analysis
  - Identification of URL root owners
- **Reporting & Alerts**: Notifies users, CERT-IN, and ISPs about threats.
- **User Interface Integration**: Verifies URLs seamlessly within applications.

## **Project Breakdown**

### **Phase 1: Machine Learning Classifier**
- Download and preprocess a dataset of URLs.
- Extract relevant features and encode them.
- Train, validate, and test the best-fit neural network model.

### **Phase 2: Database Mapping**
- Verify URLs against known databases like AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal.
- Flag malicious URLs or redirect safe ones.

### **Phase 3: Network Analysis**
- Perform WHOIS lookups and reverse IP/geolocation analysis.
- Identify malicious URL root owners and generate detailed reports.
- Alert CERT-IN and notify ISPs about flagged links.

### **Phase 4: Integration**
- Develop a user-friendly application for seamless URL verification.
